# AH-Satellite_Trails
Here you can find a code to run satellite trails detection in HST images. This code automatically uploads to Google Cloud some user selected images and launches the AutoML Vision object detection model.

We use a Python Notebook intended to be run using Google Colab. The specific instructions before/after running each cell are explained directly in the notebook.
